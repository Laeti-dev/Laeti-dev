### Hi there I'm Laeti, a fullstack developerðŸ‘‹



- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently working on a website and a portfolio using Gatsby (React/Node) and integrating the facebook basic display API to render instagram pictures. Don't mock me but no! it is not that simple :see_no_evil:.
- ðŸ“– Iâ€™m currently learning React and getting deeper understanding of Vanilla Javascript (My little favorite).
- ðŸ¤” I could definitely use some help with this not friendly Instagram API
- :airplane: My cultural background: I'm from French Guyane :french_guiana: (South America), I lived 8 years in Canada :canada: and 5 years in Japan :jp:. I'm now back to France :fr:.
- :loudspeaker: Ways to communicate with me: :fr: native, :us: TOEIC 960, :jp: JLPT N2 and trying to improve my :es: A2.
- ðŸ¤“ About me: Except from learning about coding languages, I love learning about wine and practice outside activities especially hiking and surfing. And of course, learning human languages.
